  <h2>The idea</h2>
  <p>
    The concept behind these is one of the coolest ideas Nike has ever executed
    on a Jordan 1. The black exterior layer is designed to wear away over time,
    revealing brightly coloured panels underneath.
  </p>
  <p>
    Because no two people walk, move, or wear their shoes the same way, every pair
    ends up aging differently. As the paint comes off, the shoe slowly becomes a
    record of how it’s been worn.
  </p>

  <h2>Why that matters</h2>
  <p>
    I really like that there’s no “correct” end state for these. You don’t control
    exactly how they’ll look — the shoe just becomes more personal the longer you
    wear it.
  </p>
  <p>
    Over time, no two pairs will ever look identical, even if they started that way.
    That idea alone makes them special.
  </p>

  <h2>Quick notes</h2>
  <p><strong>Standout detail:</strong> Wear-away black paint revealing colour underneath</p>
  <p><strong>Concept:</strong> Each pair ages uniquely based on how it’s worn</p>
  <p><strong>Why I like them:</strong> They reward actually wearing the shoe</p>
