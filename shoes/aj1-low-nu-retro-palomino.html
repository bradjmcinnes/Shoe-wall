  <h2>The story</h2>
  <p>
    This is one of those shoes that absolutely nobody seemed to want. So much so that I found
    them on StockX for $68; cheap enough that the reseller was clearly willing to lose money
    just to get rid of them.
  </p>
  <p>
    I loved them immediately. The colour combo, the materials, the overall vibe — it all worked
    for me, even if it clearly didn’t work for the market.
  </p>

  <h2>The “Neapolitan” shoe</h2>
  <p>
    Once I swapped in pink laces, it was over. Between the white, brown, and pink tones, people
    started calling these the “Neapolitan” shoes, and honestly, they’re not wrong.
  </p>
  <p>
    It’s one of those accidental nicknames that fits so well it just sticks.
  </p>

  <h2>Why I love them</h2>
  <p>
    These are a reminder that resale value has nothing to do with whether a shoe is actually good.
    Sometimes a shoe just misses with the crowd, and sometimes that makes it even better.
  </p>
  <p>
    I didn’t buy these because they were popular. I bought them because I liked them.
    And that’s exactly why they earn a spot on the wall.
  </p>

  <h2>Quick notes</h2>
  <p><strong>Standout detail:</strong> Pink lace swap + soft earth tones</p>
  <p><strong>Nickname:</strong> “Neapolitan”</p>
  <p><strong>Best part:</strong> Loving a shoe nobody else wanted</p>
