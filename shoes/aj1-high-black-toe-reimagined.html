  <h2>The story</h2>
  <p>
    This was my first Jordan 1 — and I bought it with maximum excitement for a reason that,
    in hindsight, is objectively hilarious.
  </p>
  <p>
    The same year the “Banned” Bred 1s were dropping, I kept hearing about how insane the hype was.
    I was still new to all of this and I genuinely thought the Black Toe Reimagined was <em>that</em> shoe.
    Like… I thought I had just secured the legendary one everyone was losing their minds over.
  </p>
  <p>
    About a week later I learned that, no, the shoe everyone was talking about was NOT the one I bought.
    I wasn’t holding the “Banned” Breds. I was holding… me being confidently wrong.
  </p>

  <h2>Why I still stand by it</h2>
  <p>
    But here’s the thing: even after I realized I didn’t buy the “right” hype shoe, I didn’t care.
    This pair kicked off my appreciation for Jordan 1s — mostly for looks, definitely not for comfort —
    and it turned into Jordan 1s becoming the shoe I’ve collected the most.
  </p>
  <p>
    So yeah, I misunderstood the moment… but I accidentally picked the silhouette that got me into it.
    I’ll take that trade every time.
  </p>

  <h2>Quick notes</h2>
  <p><strong>Standout detail:</strong> Classic Black Toe blocking (it just works)</p>
  <p><strong>Personal meaning:</strong> The shoe that started the Jordan 1 rabbit hole</p>
  <p><strong>Truth in advertising:</strong> Looks: 10/10. Comfort: we don’t talk about it.</p>
