  <h2>The context</h2>
  <p>
    When I bought these, I was about five months into working at Champs and still very much
    <em>not</em> a shoe guy. I didn’t love Jordan 3s, didn’t really understand the hype,
    and honestly wasn’t even sold on the silhouette.
  </p>
  <p>
    My full-time associate at the time, Jet, convinced me to buy them. He told me they were
    his favourite Jordan.
  </p>

  <h2>The mistake</h2>
  <p>
    I wore them to work the very next day.
  </p>
  <p>
    Two hours into my shift, my feet were absolutely killing me. I went back to Jet and said,
    “Man, these are brutal.”
  </p>
  <p>
    Without missing a beat, he replied:
    <strong>“I said they were my favourite. I never said they were comfortable.”</strong>
  </p>
  <p>
    I’ll never forget that moment. Utter betrayal.
  </p>

  <h2>What they taught me</h2>
  <p>
    As much as I don’t love wearing them, these shoes were a real lesson early on:
    hype, history, and personal comfort are three completely different things.
  </p>
  <p>
    Just because a shoe is iconic (and the Jordan 3 absolutely is) doesn’t mean it’s right
    for everyone. Especially not my feet.
  </p>

  <h2>Why they’re still here</h2>
  <p>
    Even though I genuinely don’t like wearing them, I keep them because of what they represent.
    They’re a snapshot of being new, trusting other people’s opinions, and learning quickly.
  </p>
  <p>
    Plus… the story is too good not to keep.
  </p>

  <h2>Quick notes</h2>
  <p><strong>Standout detail:</strong> Cement grey accents and elephant print</p>
  <p><strong>Comfort level:</strong> Personally offensive</p>
  <p><strong>Personal meaning:</strong> A lesson I’ll never forget</p>
