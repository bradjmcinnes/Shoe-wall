  <h2>The context</h2>
  <p>
    Once I developed an appreciation for the Jordan 2, my first Union collaboration choice
    was basically a no-brainer. The Grey Fogs felt like the cleanest intersection of a silhouette
    I already loved and a brand known for doing things thoughtfully.
  </p>
  <p>
    This wasn’t about chasing a Union collab just to say I owned one, it made sense naturally
    within my rotation.
  </p>

  <h2>The Union touch</h2>
  <p>
    The Grey Fog colourway leans into subtlety. Muted tones, layered materials, and small details
    that reward actually looking at the shoe rather than just recognizing it from across the room.
  </p>
  <p>
    It’s unmistakably a Union shoe, but it doesn’t overwhelm the Jordan 2’s already refined shape.
    Instead, it amplifies what makes the model interesting in the first place.
  </p>

  <h2>Why it works for me</h2>
  <p>
    These slid into my rotation easily. They feel intentional without feeling precious, and they
    fit right alongside the rest of my Jordan 2s without trying to steal the spotlight.
  </p>
  <p>
    If the Lucky Greens are worn deliberately, the Grey Fogs are worn confidently.
  </p>

  <h2>Quick notes</h2>
  <p><strong>Standout detail:</strong> Union’s layered materials and subtle branding</p>
  <p><strong>Vibe:</strong> Calm, considered, and very wearable</p>
  <p><strong>Personal milestone:</strong> First Union collab — and the right one</p>
