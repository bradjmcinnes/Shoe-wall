  <h2>The feeling</h2>
  <p>
    These are, without question, my favourite shoes that I own.
  </p>
  <p>
    I don’t even have a clean, logical explanation for it, I just fell in love with them immediately.
    The colour, the shape, the balance of the green against the white… something about it just clicked.
  </p>

  <h2>First StockX purchase</h2>
  <p>
    This was also my first-ever StockX purchase, which probably adds to the attachment.
    There’s something about taking that first step, trusting the process, waiting for the box,
    opening it, that makes a pair stick with you.
  </p>

  <h2>Why I don’t wear them often</h2>
  <p>
    I don’t throw these on casually. In fact, I can almost mark on the calendar every time I’ve worn them.
    Not because I’m afraid of damaging them, but because I like keeping them special.
  </p>
  <p>
    Every time I wear them, it feels deliberate. Like, “today is a Lucky Green day.”
  </p>

  <h2>Quick notes</h2>
  <p><strong>Standout detail:</strong> The green hits — bold without being loud</p>
  <p><strong>Personal meaning:</strong> Favourite pair, no contest</p>
  <p><strong>Wear philosophy:</strong> Not often — but always intentionally</p>
